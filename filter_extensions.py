"""
You will receive a folder called input, with various files with custom extensions.
You may add or remove the files as you wish, but they are the only way to test your code.
Write a program which accepts a single input line from the Console,
holding an extension â€¦ like: "txt", "bmp", "rar" etc.
Print the NAMES AND EXTENSIONS of all files, which have the given extension.

Examples

Input
txt

Output
test.000.001.in.txt
test.000.001.out.txt
test.000.002.in.txt
test.000.002.out.txt
