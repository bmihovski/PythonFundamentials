"""
Write a method to calculate the distance between two points p1 {x1, y1} and p2 {x2, y2}.
Write a program to read two points (given as two integers) and print the Euclidean distance between them.
Hints
    Create a class Point holding properties X and Y.
    Write a method CalcDistance(p1, p2) that returns the distance between the given points - a number.
    Use this formula to calculate the distance between two points. How it works?
    Let's have two points p1 {x1, y1} and p2 {x2, y2}
    Draw a right-angled triangle
    Side a = |x1 - x2|
    Side b = |y1 - y2|
    Distance == side c (hypotenuse)
    c2 = a2 + b2 (Pythagorean theorem)
Distance = c = âˆš(a^2+b^2 )
    You can use math.sqrt(number) method for calculating a square root.
    Print the distance formatted to the 3rd decimal point.

Input
3 4
6 8

Output
5.000
