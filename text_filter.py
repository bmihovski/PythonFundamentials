Write a program that takes a text and a string of banned words.
All words included in the ban list should be replaced with asterisks "*", equal to the word's length.
The entries in the ban list will be separated by a space " ".
The ban list should be entered on the first input line and the text on the second input line.

Example:

Input
Linux Windows
It is not Linux, it is GNU/Linux. Linux is merely the kernel, while GNU adds the functionality.
Therefore we owe it to them by calling the OS GNU/Linux! Sincerely, a Windows client

Output
It is not *****, it is GNU/*****. ***** is merely the kernel, while GNU adds the functionality.
Therefore we owe it to them by calling the OS GNU/*****! Sincerely, a ******* client
