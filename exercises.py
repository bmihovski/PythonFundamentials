"""
Exercises are fun â€¦ Especially when they represent a problem from your exercises.
Implement a class Exercise, which has a topic (string), a course_name (string), a judge_contest_link (string),
and problems (collection of strings).
You will receive several input lines containing information about a single exercise in the following format:
{topic} -> {course_name} -> {judge_contest_link} -> {problem1}, {problem2}. . .
You need to store every exercise in a Collection of Exercises. When you receive the command "go go go",
you end the input sequence.
You must print every exercise, in the following format:
"Exercises: {topic}
 Problems for exercises and homework for the "{course_name}" course @ SoftUni.
 Check your solutions here: {judge_contest_link}
 1. {problem1}
 2. {problem2}
 . . ."

Examples:
    Input
ObjectsAndSimpleClasses -> ProgrammingFundamentalsExtended -> https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/439 -> Exercises,
OptimizedBankingSystem, Animals, Websites, Boxes, BoxIntersection, Messages
go go go
Output
Exercises: ObjectsAndSimpleClasses
Problems for exercises and homework for the "ProgrammingFundamentalsExtended" course @ SoftUni.
Check your solutions here: https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/439
1. Exercises
2. OptimizedBankingSystem
3. Animals
4. Websites
5. Boxes
6. BoxIntersection
7. Messages
