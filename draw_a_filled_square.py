Draw at the console a filled square of size n like in the example:
1.	Read the input
2.	Create a function which will print the top and the bottom rows (they are the same). Donâ€™t forget to give it a descriptive name and to give it as a parameter some length
3.	Create the function which will print the middle rows.
4.	Use the functions that you've just created to draw a square.
